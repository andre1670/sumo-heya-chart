In the process of building this site, I have learned the basics of Javascript and CSS.
The Javascript library used for the graph part, CanvasJS, is amazing. The data of the graph is formatted in CSV which is the best choice for this type of graph.
I finished building this site in 1.5 month. I took it day by day and always will. Will be doing my own brand of writing codes. I'll gambarize and please leave feedback.
